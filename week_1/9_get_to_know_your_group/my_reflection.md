Hi everyone!

I'm excited about getting through Phase 0 and building some friendships along the way. I'm free to pair anytime after 6pm Eastern, and during the day depending on my work schedule. Drop a line anytime if you want to set up a session.

Stuff about me: I'm Duke Greene, a singer-songwriter-rapper-gamer-dad from Grand Rapids, MI. I'm an aural-kinesthetic learner and concrete random thinker who seldom gets to a solution the easy way. Before DBC started devouring all my free time last week, I'd spend it tweeting and browsing Reddit. I also like Cracked.com.

I'm recovering from a slump that was 30% physical illness and 70% performance panic, so I'm behind in my work right now and playing catch-up. I apologize for missing my first deadline; please bear with me as I ease my way back into integrity. Expect my fear email by the end of the day.

Have a great week. I'll be sending out individual messages soon to try and schedule times to pair.

Peace,
Duke

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

Whoa. What a load off. I'd been in a funk all weekend, stressing about DBC, avoiding emails and generally slacking off. Reading my own fears coming out of other people's minds really got my head back into a good place. I'm still afraid of washing out or locking up again and missing work, still worried that I'm an impostr who jumped in too quickly and that I'll fail and crash and burn and my wife will suffer through single parenthood for nine weeks for nothing. But I feel motivated, and strangely safe in being afraid. I'm not as alone as I thought I was.
