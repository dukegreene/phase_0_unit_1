* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge?

I learned that design not as simple as making stuff look pretty and then throwing it on a screen. This exercise felt like a chore, I'm very under-practiced in visual things, but I could see myself getting more excited about design as I get more familiar. 

I had a lot of more general design questions for this one, nothing very specific. I think I got into my head a little too much and stressed over big concepts rather than letting myself tinker around. Then I ended up using gomockingbird.com to do some tinkering, and it helped me loosen up a little, but I'm still a baby at this. I'm still having trouble with visualizing how I'd want my own content to look on a page. This exercise will require more attention from me as it's really not one of my strong suits. The only thing I enjoyed about it this time around was getting it over with. I might need to do a guided design tutorial or something like Code Academy for site design before I have any real desire to dig deeper.
