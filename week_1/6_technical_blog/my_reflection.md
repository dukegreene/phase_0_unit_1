## 8. [Comparing Favorite Websites](8_technical_blog/readme.md) Reflection

Blog url: http://dukegreene.github.io/unit1_projects/week1_technical_blog.html

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

I love blogging, but I'm fairly new to it. I have an easier time writing than I do researching, but I find that the more I research a post, the more views and responses I receive. Anyone can spout off about a topic, but specific info is what keeps readers engaged.

I was surprised at how long it took me to write this blog post. I struggled with deciding how specific I wanted to be. I felt pretty good about the length I settled on, but I wish I knew more about site design so I could have gotten more in-depth.

I do think the exercise helped me understand why I like the sites I like, and why I use them how I use them. It opened my eyes to a new way of lokoing at the pages I visit.
