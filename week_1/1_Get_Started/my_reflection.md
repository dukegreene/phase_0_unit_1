## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

I used the linked tutorials to set up Git and GitHub several weeks ago when I first got the email link to the old Phase 0 Prerequisites. I learned how precise Terminal commands are; if a single character was out of place, I'd have to retry that step. I also learned that there are things my Terminal won't let me do unless I enter my password first. I assume that wouldn't apply to users who don't password-protect their machines, but I could be wrong and I haven't tested it. 

My biggest struggle was this frustrated sensation that I was doing things without any context, just plugging in commands and waiting for the installs to complete themselves. It was hard for me to do the install tutorial "in the dark," as I prefer knowing why I'm doing something before I do it. I still have a few questions about how Git works, but I'll save those for the end. Maybe I'll figure out the answers on the way there. :)
