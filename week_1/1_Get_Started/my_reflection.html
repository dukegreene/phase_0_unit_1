  	<p>I came into this challenge a bit rusty; I had set up Git and GitHub several weeks ago when I first got the email link to the old Phase 0 Prerequisites. Back then, I learned how precise Terminal commands are; if a single character was out of place, I'd have to retry that step. I also learned that there are things my Terminal won't let me do unless I enter my password first. (I assume that wouldn't apply to users who don't password-protect their machines, but I could be wrong and I haven't tested it.) I feel like I'm still learning exactly what Git is, what it can do, and how to use it.</p>

  	<p>My biggest struggle was this frustrated sensation that I was doing things without any context, just plugging in commands and waiting for the installs to complete themselves. It was hard for me to do the install tutorial "in the dark," as I prefer knowing why I'm doing something before I do it. I still have a few questions about how Git works, but I'll save those for the end. Maybe I'll figure out the answers on the way there. :)</p>

	<p>---</p>

	<p>Here's my best attempt at a non-technical explanation: Git allows people to save their work at different points and return to those points whenever they want. If you were a portrait artist, Git would be like a magical canvas that remembers your creation at every step. Imagine painting a face, then deciding you wanted to change the eyes. A Git canvas could hold on to the original face sketch for you as you painted different types of eyes, always ready to erase bad paint and let you start over. And it could even keep track of each eye type you painted, so you wouldn't have to obsess about getting the eyes perfect before moving on to the nose or mouth.</p>

	<p>That's not even the cool part. Git lets you work as a team, so another painter could be testing out different kinds of hairstyles and outfits while you worked on facial features, and when you'd both decided you were done, the magic canvas would combine your work into one perfect portrait. Plus, the canvas would still remember every set of strokes the two of you had tried along the way, so if the portrait started to look muddled or alien in some way, you could backtrack to the last feature you painted before things went haywire, and start from there.</p>

	<p>GitHub is like a public gallery full of these magic canvases. Every artist (aka programmer) who joins GitHub gets their own wing, plus access to all the other artists' work. In this miraculous gallery, a painter can create perfect copies of someone else's in-progress art, take them into his own studio, and add strokes of his own. If the original artist likes the additions enough, she can choose to make them a part of the publicly-displayed piece. Artists can also examine a finished masterpiece, going back in time through every layer of its creation to see what makes that beautiful painting so beautiful. In such a gallery, the paint would never run dry, no creative idea would be too crazy to try out, and art would become a group activity where everyone can learn from each other. That's basically the environment GitHub strives to create for programmers.</p>

	<p>---</p>

	<p>Version control is a way to keep track of all the changes made to a project during its development. With version control it is possible to make changes to a file without losing the original work; the changed file is stored alongside the original as a different version, and it's possible to view any version at any time. This opens up a lot of room for creativity and experiementation, because if you accidentally break something, you can always revert to the last working version and try again. (I think Apple's Time Capsule is a kind of version control for the contents of my hard drive.) Git helps with version control by saving snapshots of saved work as "commits," which can sync with other users working on the same project. With Git, users can merge their work together, track who made changes to what, and keep local copies of their project to speed things up. Actually, most of what Git does is local; it was built to speed up version control processes typically slowed down by networks.</p>

	<p>---</p>

	<p>Developers use version control because development is messy. Version control keeps the mess manageable. Without it, programming would be like walking on eggshells, with buggy danger lurking in every line of code. With it, developers can feel free to explore, to make mistakes, to try new things without the fear of permanently breaking something. It also lets multiple people work on solutions to a problem at once. There's no need to create redundant copies of a file for safety, version control handles that internally. And with the ability to merge work, individuals can tackle a big problem from multiple directions and meet on a common ground as all the changes are resolved into one. Locally based version control (ie Git) also saves on time and network load, enabling organizations to work more safely and sleekly. Most of this makes perfect sense to me in principle, but I'm still trying to get my head around how version control differs from the anal retentive practice of making multiple backups of everything. And as I type that, I realize one more benefit: It's easier to manage work with verison control than it is with a folder full of serially-numbered files and no context as to who made what file or why.</p>

	<p>---</p>

	<p>Here's what makes sense to me: When a project gets to be a certain size, it becomes necessary to have a good system for documenting, saving, and sharing the work. Version control makes this possible, and Git/GitHub make it fast and visually interesting to boot. I get those parts.</p>

	<p>What I don't get is the how. How does Git differentiate between file saves and commits? How does it know how to merge multiple users' work? Do users get input into that step? What happens to branches that don't get used - do they vanish or can they be saved for other projects? How does Git know which file is the "real" file, and which is just a changed version...or is there no "real" file, just a collection of snapshots and changes?</p>
