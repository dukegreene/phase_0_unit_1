  <h2>Reflection Questions:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?</li>
    <li>Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience.</li>
    <li>Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.</li>
    <li>Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?</li>
    <li>What doesn't make sense? What does?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I came into this challenge a bit rusty; Ihad set up Git and GitHub several weeks ago when I first got the email link to the old Phase 0 Prerequisites. Back then, I learned how precise Terminal commands are; if a single character was out of place, I'd have to retry that step. I also learned that there are things my Terminal won't let me do unless I enter my password first. (I assume that wouldn't apply to users who don't password-protect their machines, but I could be wrong and I haven't tested it.) I feel like I'm still learning exactly what Git is, what it can do, and how to use it.</p>

  <p>My biggest struggle was this frustrated sensation that I was doing things without any context, just plugging in commands and waiting for the installs to complete themselves. It was hard for me to do the install tutorial "in the dark," as I prefer knowing why I'm doing something before I do it. I still have a few questions about how Git works, but I'll save those for the end. Maybe I'll figure out the answers on the way there. :)</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Here's my best attempt at a non-technical explanation: Git allows people to save their work at different points and return to those points whenever they want. If you were a portrait artist, Git would be like a magical canvas that remembers your creation at every step. Imagine painting a face, then deciding you wanted to change the eyes. A Git canvas could hold on to the original face sketch for you as you painted different types of eyes, always ready to erase bad paint and let you start over. And it could even keep track of each eye type you painted, so you wouldn't have to obsess about getting the eyes perfect before moving on to the nose or mouth.</p>

<p>That's not even the cool part. Git lets you work as a team, so another painter could be testing out different kinds of hairstyles and outfits while you worked on facial features, and when you'd both decided you were done, the magic canvas would combine your work into one perfect portrait. Plus, the canvas would still remember every set of strokes the two of you had tried along the way, so if the portrait started to look muddled or alien in some way, you could backtrack to the last feature you painted before things went haywire, and start from there.</p>

<p>GitHub is like a public gallery full of these magic canvases. Every artist (aka programmer) who joins GitHub gets their own wing, plus access to all the other artists' work. In this miraculous gallery, a painter can create perfect copies of someone else's in-progress art, take them into his own studio, and add strokes of his own. If the original artist likes the additions enough, she can choose to make them a part of the publicly-displayed piece. Artists can also examine a finished masterpiece, going back in time through every layer of its creation to see what makes that beautiful painting so beautiful. In such a gallery, the paint would never run dry, no creative idea would be too crazy to try out, and art would become a group activity where everyone can learn from each other. That's basically the environment GitHub strives to create for programmers.</p>
