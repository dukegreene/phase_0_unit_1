  <h4 style="font-family: Verdana; color: #1f5c99">My Reflection</h4>
  
  <p>To create a repository on GitHub, log in to github.com. (If you don't have a login, visit github.com/join and follow the instructions to create a username and password.) Then either click the green "New Repository" button on the GitHub homepage, or type "github.com/new" into your browser bar. This will take you to the Create a New Repository page. Click in the box under "repository name" and type a name for your new repository. Under "Description (optional)", you can write a brief summary of what you'll be using the repository for. It's probably a good idea to check the "Initialize this repository with a README" button too. You can click the "Add a License" box to add one of several <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses">open source licenses</a> to your repository.</p>
  
  <p>Now for the tricky part. If you haven't installed Git yet, you can do so <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">here</a>. Once Git is installed, you'll want to open Terminal. To do that, click on your desktop and press Shift-Command-G on your keyboard. A window will pop up asking for a folder. Type "applications/utilities" and press Enter and you'll be taken to the folder that contains the Terminal app. Double click the app to open it. Now you'll want to figure out where to put your repository. Use the Finder (the folder browser window you just opened) to navigate to the folder where you want your repository to go. Once you're in there, click View in the menu bar at the very top of your screen and click "Show Path Bar." (If it says "Hide Path Bar", don't touch anything. You're ready for the next step.) At the bottom of your Finder window, you'll see a list of folders the rightmost folder is the one you're about to deal with. In your Terminal window, type "cd " (the space is important!) and then click and drag the icon of that folder into your Terminal window. Now, you'll see "cd [folderpath]" where "cd " was the text you just typed and [folderpath] is a list of folders/separated/by/slashes/like/this. Press Enter.</p>
  
  <p>You're almost done. In Terminal, type "git init" and press Enter to get the folder ready for your repository. Now head back into your browser and look along the right hand side for a box below the words "HTTPS clone url". Click in that box once and it should highlight all the text. Press Command-C to copy the text, then return to your Terminal. There, you need to type "git clone " and then press Command V after you've typed the space. Press Enter and you'll see some funky looking words moving around for a few seconds, and that's it! You're all set.</p>

  <p>"Open source" refers to work that is free to use, modify, or share. People who release open source software allow the world to see the code that made the software, and anyone can add to the code to improve the functionality of that software. Some companies rely on open source products to function, sacrificing proprietary safety for open agility. There are a variety of different open source licenses that affect everything from attribution to distribution, whether a piece of code can be sold or stolen. As a musician, I can understand the desire for the creator of something valuable to protect their livelihood by restricting access to paid customers. But the best music I've ever made happened with a whole band, and open source creates the kind of atmosphere where people can get together and make something really beautiful. Ultimately, the really beautful stuff makes money anyway. I think open source will continue to grow and evolve toward something that creates more economic fairness in software development or at least levels the playing field for those with more willpower than walletpower.</p>

  <p>Licenses allow users access to your work without restricting any rights or forfeiting any ownership. They are basically permission slips to use the open source project for different purposes. With proper license usage, you can allow and prevent the sharing, sale, or reattribution of your work. You can make the license as open or restrictive as you like, depending on your goals, needs, and philosophy.</p>

  <p>I had forgotten how Git worked, and I was grateful that this challenge shook the cobwebs off. ("git clone" had been on the tip of my tongue for an hour.) I am a little more comfortable finding my way around the GitHub interface, and I'm getting the hang of this html markup in the process. My "aha" moment came today as I wrote my instructions for the Git repo cloning at the top of this page. I realized that it's just as hard to tell a low-tech person how to do a technical thing (install software) as it is to tell a computer how to do a low-tech thing (play checkers). I had to think of every step the person could take and every way something could go wrong, then write instructions that would make it hard to reach those wrong outcomes. It made me appreciate how well the curriculum is put together so far.</p>

<p>I found this <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_colorpicker.asp">color picker</a> that guided me to the hex colors I used in my headers up there.
