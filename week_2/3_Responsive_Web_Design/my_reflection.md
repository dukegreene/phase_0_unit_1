# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Responsive web design is design that is usable by people with different viewing experiences, be they biological or device-related. Though it can be tedious to re-code styles for different screen sizes or add alt tags to images, responsive design is ultimately a good thing, because it removes barriers between the user and the content. So far, smartphones and tablets have changed how "clicking" can be done, as well as introduced a different wealth of aspect ratios. In the future, flexible screens and 3D devices will necessitate even more responsiveness.

Visually impaired people need to use special readers to describe page data with audio. It's a much more tedious process and it requires careful attention to link and image naming to make a page readable for the blind. Still, it's necessary to make these design choices because the alternative is a page that some people can't connect to, and user experience is the key to good design.

The concept that really stuck for me was the idea of putting myself in the user's shoes, anticipating how they would use a page and really walking through every aspect of a page to ask how it could be better or simpler or easier to use.
