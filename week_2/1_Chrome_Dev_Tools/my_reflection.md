# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

The Document Object Model is like a bridge between HTML markup and programming. It translates markup into an object-based language structure so elements of a web page can be changed through the use of Javascript. It seems to be enabling the main difference between websites and web apps: interactivity. It makes sense that something would have to bridge the gap, but I'm not sure why Javascript in particular was chosen as the go-to language, possibly because it was so widely used. I'm not yet sure why DOM has to be its own thing, why there can't just be a call within HTML to load this or that piece of Javascript. It seems good overall because it allows people to take more control over their site design and functionality. However, one negative might be the possibility of confusion when translating between two distinct languages - I could see myself forgetting whether something was a class or an id, or messing up a parent-child relationship, and throwing a whole project off.

Using Dev Tools, my site looks like a single green pepper cut in half. Wordpress looks like freaking paella. I couldn't wrap my mind around most of the WP markup. Every single element there seemed to call back to multiple css files, compared to my very straightforward (and much more limited) page. I imagine wordpress' intricacy creates simplicity; all the class/id names made sense, and it was clear that each blog post is treated as one (database?) item with multiple attributes. That would be necessary if you had to plug in new posts frequently...you couldn't get away with just editing each post as a unit.

Dev Tools is a bit of a pain due to screen size constraints and an overall unfamiliarity with the layout or functionality of it, but help seems to be lurking around every corner in the form of in-app links (and Google itself). Overall, it's a lot of fun to crack open the hood and see a site's moving pieces. Before this exercise, I thought I could only observe; I had no idea I could use Dev Tools to edit markup and style on the fly. Way cool.

Today's was more of a meta-aha: I had been stuck and afraid of failing, and then when I thought of starting back up where I left off, I felt even more stuck - how would I possibly catch up? But then when I actually started going through the challenges, things got a lot easier to stomach, and I feel like I've earned back a lot of momentum today. One concept that got more solidified was how elements are named in CSS. By lokoing at more complex sites, I got used to seeing longer and more involved trees, like .events > .event and so on.

The provided resources were sufficient for me to complete this exercise, I didn't look any further.
