# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: https://dukegreene.github.io/index.html

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I learned about the importance of simplicity in design. My natural tendency is to clutter the screen with lots of words, since they're basically the content I created. But the reading I did taught me that I should put the user experience first and use white space and uncomplicated layouts to make navigation simplaer for people visiting a page I made. I like making things that look nice, but it's way more fun for me to conceptualize my designs than it is to actually dig in and work them out of the markup. Planning the site was my favorite part. My process involved visualizing how I would want to browse through someone's personal page, then trying to get out of the way and let that browsing experience happen. The next step will be to get some custom icons loaded up and add some mouse-over effects. It was pretty hard for me to use white space effectively, and I think I can do better in the future.
