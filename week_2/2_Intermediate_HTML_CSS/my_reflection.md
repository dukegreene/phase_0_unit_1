# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I don't know if web standards are good or bad, just necessary in an age with multiple browsers running commerce and government sites. Without web standards, developers would have trouble making sites that can run on different types of platforms, and it would also be harder to manage around design needs without some set defaults. One annoying thing about web standards is that they might curtail the spread of better standards that aren't yet as widely popular. But standards seem necessary in our vast and diverse web environment.

Standard structure makes sense to me. It seems reasonable to build off the most basic possible structure so as to exclude the fewest number of devices and browsers from seeing content.

I almost wish there were more HTML5 elements. I like them a lot, because they keep html neater, with fewer '<div>s' and more specific names. It would be nice if not all the new elements were blocks by default.

Reset.css is necessary because it keeps the browser from seizing control of a pages style. By setting explicit defaults for all of a page's elements, reset.css puts control in the hands of the developer, not a given browser's interpretation of site elements. (This helped me understand the purpose better: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11578819/css-reset-what-exactly-does-it-do)

I use Chrome 95% of the time, Firefox 4% of the time, and Safari/other 1% of the time. Sometimes fonts look slightly different in different browsers, or margins seem moved slightly. But for the most part, a page I view in Chrome doesn't really look different in another browser. I like this, because I don't think it's good design to have to relearn what I'm seeing when I visit a page on a different browser. I get the feeling that I'd feel much more strongly about all this if I used Internet Explorer.
